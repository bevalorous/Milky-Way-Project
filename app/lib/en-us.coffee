      title: 'Why Scientists Need You'
      g_01: '''The Milky Way Project (MWP) shows you data taken from the Spitzer Space Telescope. Specifically from the <span title="Galactic Legacy Infrared Mid-Plane Survey Extraordinaire">GLIMPSE</span> survey. What you see is actually the infrared light from deep within our galaxy, the Milky Way. This is not what you would see with your eyes. In fact, that is exactly why astronomers have collected so much infrared data in the past twenty years: we are trying to understand the diffuse material, called dust, that creates the beautiful structures in these images. You can read more about dust below.'''
      g_02:'''We're looking into the cold, murky depths of interstellar space for interesting shapes and features. The bubbles and star clusters we sometimes see in these images are part of the life cycle of stars. Some bubbles have already been found - by the first version of the MWP - but we want to find them in other parts of the galaxy. The first MWP was so successful that we have expanded the search to new regions in the Milky Way. We're building up a comprehensive view of not only these bubbles, but our galaxy as a whole. We're asking you to help us map star formation in our galaxy.'''
      g_03: '''As well as bubbles and stars clusters there are other objects hidden throughout these images such as strange green objects seen near young stars (called EGOs) and never-before-seen galaxies that lie far beyond our own galaxy, hidden behind the stars and dust. If you see anything unusual in the images, make sure to mark it and give your best guess as to what it is. We hope to map out these objects and then use your discoveries to make more observations. You might even discover something we didn't expect.'''
    bubbles:
      title: 'Interstellar Dust'
      b_01: '''Imagine holding a single grain of sand in your hand. Pretty small, right? Now shrink that grain of sand tenfold. This is roughly how big interstellar dust particles are. Yet this incredibly tiny piece of material exists in such huge quantity in the Universe, that it has huge consequences. Dust one-tenth the size of a grain of sand is one of the key players in the process of star formation. Massive clouds of dust and gas are what collapse to begin to form stars.'''
      b_02: '''The trouble is that this dust, composed of tiny silicon particles, is behaving in unexpected ways. It appears to be able to survive near hot, massive OB stars, when the interstellar winds and radiation pressure should force this usually cold dust to heat up and scatter. Bubbles are interesting places - they are 'holes' in our understanding of star formation.'''
      b_03: '''The answer might be found in examining partial and closed rings - bubbles - that exist in the galaxy, and this is one of the aims of the Milky Way Project. By looking at bubbles in our galaxy, the Milky Way, we hope to get a better understanding of star formation, which can in turn help us understand these mysterious characteristics of the dust that is so important in creating stars.'''
      b_04: '''How is it that we know the bubbles indicate sites of active star formation? Because bubbles are made by hot stars, and hot stars are generally found dominating clusters containing several hundred to several thousand low-mass stars apiece! Hot stars also don't live long enough to move far from the clouds where they formed. All this means that each bubble represents several hundred to several thousand very young stars.'''

  data:
    content: 'We aim to provide public periodic releases of Milky Way Project data. On this page you can download the first release of data from 2012. Our first data release paper was published in the Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society and is available on arXiv. It describes the reduction of more than half a million bubble drawings by users of the Milky Way Project into a catalogue of 5,106 bubbles.'

  faq:
    q01:
      ans: '''The images shown in the Milky Way Project were taken with a camera onboard the Spitzer Space Telescope, as part of a survey called GLIMPSE, which aimed to map around 85% of the plane of the Milky Way galaxy. Over 440,000 images were taken for this survey. The galactic plane is where most of the young stars, gas and dust are located, and Spitzer is especially sensitive to those. The high resolution of the Spitzer infrared camera makes it possible to see fine detail in these clouds, and the bubbles we see are a great example of that.'''
      question: '''What are we looking at in these images?'''
    q02:
      ans: '''These images are from places all along the plane of the Milky Way. At night in darker areas you can see the Milky Way as a bright stripe across the sky. The region covered by these images is about as wide as a finger's length held at arm's length away from you, and stretches all the way around the earth following the brightest part of the Milky Way's stripe.'''
      question: '''What part of the night sky are we seeing?'''
    q03:
      ans: '''That's part of what we're trying to find out with this project! Right now our best understanding is that these are regions around young massive stars that are so bright that their light has caused a shock wave to affect the cloud around them and blown a bubble which we can see in infrared light. The red area is where the shock has already passed by and the bright green ring around it is where the shock is currently impacting the gas cloud.'''
      question: '''What are these bubbles anyway?'''
    q04:
      ans: '''Most of the circular features (bubbles) in these images are produced by hot young stars, as winds and radiation from these young stars sweep up the surrounding gas and dust from which they formed (like a snowplow that compresses the snow in its path.) Sometimes, the swept-up material becomes dense enough for gravity to pull it together to form new stars.'''
      question: '''What has this got to do with star formation?'''
    q05: 
      ans: '''Relax! We're sure you are. This sort of pattern recognition is something humans are very good at, and so just take your best guess at each image as it comes up. Several people will be shown each image, so don't worry too much about making a simple mistake. If you want some more guidance, then revisit the tutorial or read the extended version.'''
      question: '''How do I know if I'm any good?'''
    q06:
      ans: '''They're stored with those provided by everyone who takes part. The Milky Way Project team will carefully analyse the results to make surethat collectively we’re producing results that are useful to scientists — keep an eye on the blog for details. All results will eventually be made public for anyone to use."'''
      question: '''What happens to the classifications I provide?'''
    q07:
      ans: '''If you'd like to change your mind during working on a particular image, you can delete bubbles you've marked using the X button. Once you'vefinished an image, and your classification has been submitted to our database, then you can't change it, but don't worry — we compare classifications from multiple users so someone else will correct any mistakes."'''
      question: '''How can I change a classification?'''
    q08:
      ans: '''It is not possible to redo a classification, as we want each one to be independent. Allowing classifications to be replaced would open up thepossibility of classifiers discussing images and changing their classifications to agree with one another. This would reduce our ability to understand the uncertainties in the classifications. However, don't worry about our final results: each image will be looked at by many people, so on average the classification is likely to be correct, and occasional mistakes don't matter.'''
      question: '''Can I redo a classification?'''
    q09:
      ans: '''If one person classificaties these images — even if they're an expert — then anything odd or interesting can be blamed on them. With multipleindependent classifications we can statistically calculate the confidence in our work, and that's a large part of the power of Milky Way Project."'''
      question: '''Why do you need so many people to help?'''
    q10:
      ans: '''Light is a wave, specifically a wave of electromagnetic energy, and it comes in a wide range of wavelengths. Light that we see, or visible light, are electromagnetic waves that oscillate back and forth every 0.4-0.7 microns (there are a thousand microns in a millimeter, or a million microns in a meter). Infrared is light that has longer wavelengths, from 0.7 microns all the way up to about 300 microns.  The shorter-wavelength end of that range is called near infrared because it is near to visible light, and the longer-wavelength range is called far infrared.'''
      question: '''What is infrared?'''
    q11:
      ans: '''These images come from two instruments, both aboard the Spitzer Space Telescope.  One of the instruments took images at wavelengths in the 3-8 micron range (and that light is coloured green in these images) and the other took images at a wavelength of 24 microns, which is coloured red.'''
      question: '''What wavelength are these images?'''
    q00:
      ans: '''All the stars you see in the night sky are part of a very large group of stars (a few hundred billion) that we call the Milky Way Galaxy. If you've ever looked at the night sky from a dark location, you've probably seen the band of light that we also call the 'Milky Way'. This band of light contains most of the stars in the Milky Way Galaxy, and the images you're inspecting all come from a narrow band only a few full moons wide along the Milky Way.'''
      question: '''WHY IS IT CALLED THE MILKY WAY PROJECT?'''
    q12:
      ans: '''All the objects you see are in the Milky Way, and essentially all of them will be on our side of the Milky Way since the stuff on the far side is mostly obscured by all the things in the way.  The objects you do see will range from about 1,000 to 25,000 light years away.  The more distant ones will probably be smaller and the closer ones larger, but not always! There might be some extremely large, distant bubbles that appear bigger than some small, nearby ones.'''
      question: '''How far away are these objects?'''
